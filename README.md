# Rust/React Fizz Buzz

This repository contains both the bare-metal Rust implementation and the React/Redux implementation
of a FizzBuzz application. Its goal is to show that the same design patterns that are common in 
web development, and often called "overkill", can easily be applied to bare-metal, memory-constrained
embedded application, resulting in more testable and composable software.
